# Metrics

Metric 1 (NPS): Create a survey form on a new page with a question on a scale from 1-10 ('How likely are you to recommend this app to a friend or colleague?'), button on golden path homepage where users can find the survey

Metric 3 (DAU): Firebase Analytics automatically tracks DAU. No additional code is necessary as this is a built-in metric available through Firebaseâ€™s engagement tracking.
