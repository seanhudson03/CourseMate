# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Decision Making

Decisions will be made on a majority rule basis, where three out of four group 
members must agree before a decision goes forward. In the event that there is
a tie, the decision must be altered to compromise until a majority has been
reached.

## Attendance

Attendance is not mandatory but is recommended. Attendance will become an issue 
in the event that a group member is found to be contributing significantly less
than other team members, or that they are failing to communicate with the team.
Group members must let the team know as soon as possible when they will be absent, 
and must continue to take their share of the project remotely. Absence does not 
require an excuse. 

## Assignments

Assignments will be split up based on team member's preference and strengths. If 
a team member completes their assignment poorly, they may be asked to redo their 
tasks until they are satisfactory. In the event that a team member does not complete 
their tasks on time, the team will discuss taking further disciplinary action, and 
at a minimum create documentation for the issue. 

## Participation

Communication will be handled in person and remotely via a Discord server. Full particpation
will be monitored via commit history and the Kanban board's assignees feature. If 
a group member is contributing significantly less than other team members, documentation 
will be made and further action may be considered. Honoring strengths and interests of 
team members will be handled by allowing team members their choice of tasks during
scrum meetings. If a team member is not present, they may not be allowed their first choice. In
addition, they may not be allowed a vote in any decision making. 

## Meeting Times

Meeting times and locations will be chosen by the team in Discord. If group members cannot attend 
a meeting, they must give the team notice. Missing a meeting may mean that a team member
is assigned work that they would not have personally chosen, and they may have difficulty
contributing as much as required.

## Minutes and Notes

Team members will rotate to determine who takes notes during meetings. Minutes will be provided
by the current Sprint Backlog, and any other issues team members feel necessary to discuss. 

## Lateness

As long as a team member is not late to the extent that they can not make a meaningful 
contribution to the discussion, there will not be penalty for lateness. Lateness greater than 
10 minutes after the meeting start time requires notice. 

## Conversational Courtesy

Team members must remain respectful during discussions. If a team member is found to be 
disrespectful during a meeting, the team will discuss this issue with a verbal warning, 
and consider further action if this continues. Group members should have equal opportunity
to share their thoughts and ideas.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Feedback

Feedback will be given in the form of comments on issues. Every team member is 
allowed to give and recieve feedback.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
